    //Call the function.

//Part II : function with three parameters

//Create a function called infoAboutPerson(personName, personAge, personFavoriteColor) that takes 3 parameters.
//The function should console.log a sentence about the person (ie. ‚ÄúYou name is ‚Ä¶, you are .. years old, your favorite color is ‚Ä¶‚Äù)

  //Instructions - John created a simple tip calculator to help calculate how much to tip when he and his family go to restaurants.
  //Create a function named calculateTip() that takes no parameter.

  //If the bill is less than $50, tip 20%.
  //If the bill is between $50 and $200, tip 15%.
